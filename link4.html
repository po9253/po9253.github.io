      <p1 style="color:white">If I'm searching for compliments to give DC's weird, bizarre, tonal-whiplash of a movie run these last few years, then I at least have to give them props for zagging while everyone else is zigging. You simply cannot do Christopher Nolan's Michael Mann tone without Nolan, and you can't beat Heath. So you veer left. Take a sharp turn back into pop art cartoonish absurdism a la Schumacher at his best (read: Batman Forever). At least, that was the intent. Even with the caveat of tongue-in-cheek, Leto's take on the Clown Prince of Crime is little more than a leering goon straight out of an early-aughts video game, but somehow with a weird '40s Dick Tracy voice affectation. More cartoonish than Mark Hamill, and with no substance to support it. But the script and movie housing his only appearance (to date) as Joker to date do him no favors, and yet, Leto, with his Jaws-like sporadic appearances, is one of the only currents that keep the film alive. So maybe it could've been a different story in different settings? â€”Frazier Tharpe
