      <h3 style="color:purple"> Appeared in: The Dark Knight</h3>
      <P1 style="color:white">You've just got to face facts: Heath Ledger did that. With The Dark Knight sitting firmly as many people's favorite Batflick of all time, you can't front like it'd be the same film without A. the Joker's presence and B. Ledger's performance as the Joker. Teetering on the brink of all-out insanity, Heath took on Joker at his most sadistic, from the grotesque grin that appears to be carved into his face to the twists and turns his vocal inflections make while pushing his lines out. Christopher Nolan crafted a dark, brooding playground for the Joker and Batman to dance in, and Ledger matched Christian Bale's intensity with a true representation of what the Joker has evolved into for people. While Jack Nicholson may have had more fun with it, and Joaquin Phoenix nailed the disturbing nature lying under the surface, Ledger married both camps, seemingly having the most fun at his most violent. An Academy Award-winning performance featuring Joker at his most intense? Let's put a smile on that face.â€”khal</P1>
