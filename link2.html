      <p1 style="color:white">If Jack's here then you know who No. 1 is, and yes he deserves it, but what we will not do is act like the battle for the top spot isn't a slugfest. What Jack did here is nothing short of iconic, in every definition of the word. Is he playing Jack Napier/Joker as a slightly more homicidal facsimile of, well, Jack Nicholson? Sure, maybe, who cares? Nicholson in the purple suit notched just as many one-liners as The Dark Knight gave us and he went dumb in a museum to new Prince music while doing so, a dancing, fun-loving maniac who might be hammy but also might shoot his most loyal man in the face because he needs to take his anger out on someone. Jack being on autopilot here is the wrong take—he forces everyone around him, and subsequently, all villains in superhero movies to follow, to rise to his level of theatricality. It's a meta-performance that considers itself: cast me as a homicidal psychopath in a mauve suit and clown makeup? You wanna get nuts? Let's get nuts then. —Frazier Tharpe
